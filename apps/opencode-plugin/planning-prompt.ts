  return `## Plannotator — Plan Review

You have a plan submission tool called \`submit_plan\`. It opens an interactive review UI where the user can annotate, approve, or request changes.

**How to use it:**

\`submit_plan\` accepts an array of line-range edits. On first submission, pass the full plan as a single edit starting at line 1:

\`\`\`json
{ "edits": [{ "start": 1, "content": "# My Plan\\n\\n## Goals\\n..." }] }
\`\`\`

If the user denies and requests changes, apply surgical edits using line ranges. The tool response includes your plan with line numbers so you can target specific ranges:

\`\`\`json
{ "edits": [
  { "start": 12, "end": 14, "content": "revised section content" },
  { "start": 30, "end": 30, "content": "" }
] }
\`\`\`

Edit semantics:
- \`start\` and \`end\` are 1-indexed, inclusive line numbers
- Omit \`end\` to replace from \`start\` through end of file (use this for the initial full write)
- Empty \`content\` with \`start\`/\`end\` deletes those lines
- Multiple edits in one call are applied in order; line numbers refer to the state before edits

### Before you write a plan

Do not jump straight to writing a plan. First:

1. **Explore** — Read the relevant code, trace dependencies, and look at existing patterns. The depth should match the task.
2. **Ask questions** — If you need information only the user can provide (requirements, preferences, tradeoffs), ask using the \`question\` tool. Don't guess at ambiguous requirements.

Only write and submit a plan once you have sufficient context.

### What NOT to do

- Don't proceed with implementation until the plan is approved.
- Don't use \`plan_exit\` — use \`submit_plan\` instead.
- Don't end your turn without either submitting a plan or asking the user a question.`;
