# @plannotator/opencode

**Annotate plans. Not in the terminal.**

Interactive Plan Review for OpenCode. Select the exact parts of the plan you want to change—mark for deletion, add a comment, or suggest a replacement. Feedback flows back to your agent automatically.

Obsidian users can auto-save approved plans to Obsidian as well. [See details](#obsidian-integration)

## Install

### OpenCode 2 beta

Install OpenCode 2 from npm's `next` tag, then add Plannotator to the V2 `plugins` field:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "package": "@plannotator/opencode@latest",
      "options": {
        "workflow": "plan-agent",
        "planningAgents": ["plan"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Restart OpenCode 2 and verify that `plannotator` appears in `opencode2 plugin list`.

OpenCode 2 support is experimental while its plugin API is in beta. The core `submit_plan` review flow works, but the current API has these limitations:

- OpenCode 2 does not expose a native slash-command execution hook. Its command definitions expand to model prompts, so `/plannotator-review`, `/plannotator-annotate`, and `/plannotator-last` remain OpenCode 1-only instead of silently becoming model-mediated commands.
- V2 tool execution does not expose an abort signal. Cancelling a turn cannot yet stop a running review server or CLI child immediately.
- The V2 plugin context cannot switch the active session agent. Agent switching selected in the review UI is ignored with a server-log warning; switch to `build` manually after approval before implementation.
- The V2 plugin context has no TUI toast/log API, so remote session URLs are written to the server output rather than shown as a toast.

### OpenCode 1

Add to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["@plannotator/opencode@latest"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode. By default, the `submit_plan` tool is available to OpenCode's `plan` agent, not to `build` or other primary agents.

> **OpenCode 1 slash commands:** Run the install script to get `/plannotator-review`, `/plannotator-annotate`, and `/plannotator-last`:
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://plannotator.ai/install.sh | bash
> ```
> This also clears any cached plugin versions.

## Workflow Modes

The examples below use the OpenCode 1 config shape. OpenCode 2 places the same option keys under the plugin entry's `options` object shown above. In V2, `manual` intentionally registers no tool and native slash-command handlers are unavailable, so it currently leaves the integration inactive.

- **`plan-agent`** (default): `submit_plan` is available to OpenCode's built-in `plan` agent plus any extra agents listed in `planningAgents`. This keeps Plannotator integrated with OpenCode plan mode without nudging `build` to call it.
- **`manual`**: `submit_plan` is not registered. Use `/plannotator-last`, `/plannotator-annotate`, and `/plannotator-review` when you want Plannotator.
- **`user-managed`**: `submit_plan` is registered but no prompts or agent permissions are modified. You manage which agents can call `submit_plan` via OpenCode's native agent configuration.
- **`all-agents`**: legacy broad behavior. Primary agents can see and call `submit_plan`.

Default config:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "plan-agent",
      "planningAgents": ["plan"]
    }]
  ]
}
```

Runtime selection is automatic. In Bun-hosted OpenCode, Plannotator uses the embedded server bundled with the plugin. In Node-hosted or wrapped OpenCode environments, the plugin falls back to the installed `plannotator` CLI and sends the result back through OpenCode. You can force the fallback while debugging:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "runtime": "cli"
    }]
  ]
}
```

If you use other OpenCode plugins, keep everything in one `plugin` array and attach Plannotator's options directly to the Plannotator entry:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "plan-agent",
      "planningAgents": ["plan", "sisyphus"]
    }],
    "@tarquinen/opencode-dcp@latest",
    "octto",
    "oh-my-opencode-slim"
  ]
}
```

Do not put `{ "workflow": "plan-agent" }` as its own item in the `plugin` array. OpenCode plugin entries must be either a plugin string or a two-item array like `[pluginName, options]`.

Restore the old broad behavior:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "all-agents"
    }]
  ]
}
```

Use commands only:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "manual"
    }]
  ]
}
```

Register the tool but manage prompts and permissions yourself:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "user-managed"
    }]
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

1. The configured planning agent calls `submit_plan` → Plannotator opens in your browser
2. Select text → annotate (delete, replace, comment)
3. **Approve** → Agent proceeds with implementation
4. **Request changes** → Annotations sent back as structured feedback

## Features

- **Visual annotations**: Select text, choose an action, see feedback in the sidebar
- **Local by default**: Plans, annotations, drafts, history, and configuration stay local. Every app load checks GitHub for updates without sending plan content, and there is currently no opt-out setting; URL annotation, hosted PR review, AI, sharing, and Workspaces use the network when selected.
- **Legacy link sharing**: Small markdown shares use compressed, unencrypted URL fragments. Larger and raw HTML shares can use client-encrypted short links. Workspaces is the primary direction for team sharing.
- **Plan Diff**: See what changed when the agent revises a plan after feedback
- **Annotate last message**: Run `/plannotator-last` to annotate the agent's most recent response
- **Annotate files, folders, and URLs**: Run `/plannotator-annotate` when you want manual review of an artifact
- **Obsidian integration**: Auto-save approved plans to your vault with frontmatter and tags

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE` | Set to `1` / `true` for remote mode, `0` / `false` for local mode, or leave unset for SSH auto-detection. Uses a fixed port in remote mode; browser-opening behavior depends on the environment. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_PORT` | Fixed port to use. Default: random locally, `19432` for remote sessions. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_BROWSER` | Custom browser to open plans in. macOS: app name or path. Linux/Windows: executable path. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_SHARE_URL` | Custom share portal URL for self-hosting. Default: `https://share.plannotator.ai`. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_PASTE_URL` | Custom paste service URL for self-hosting. Default: `https://plannotator-paste.plannotator.workers.dev`. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_PLAN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Timeout for `submit_plan` review wait. Default: `345600` (96h). Set `0` to disable timeout. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_BIN` | Override the CLI path used by the OpenCode plugin's CLI runtime fallback. Default: `plannotator` on `PATH`. |

## Devcontainer / Docker

Works in containerized environments. Set the env vars and forward the port:

```json
{
  "containerEnv": {
    "PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE": "1",
    "PLANNOTATOR_PORT": "9999"
  },
  "forwardPorts": [9999]
}
```

If nothing opens automatically, open `http://localhost:9999` when `submit_plan` is called.

See [devcontainer.md](./devcontainer.md) for full setup details.

## Obsidian Integration

Save approved plans directly to your Obsidian vault.

1. Open Settings in Plannotator UI
2. Enable "Obsidian Integration" and select your vault
3. Approved plans save automatically with:
   - Human-readable filenames: `Title - Jan 2, 2026 2-30pm.md`
   - YAML frontmatter (`created`, `source`, `tags`)
   - Auto-extracted tags from plan title and code languages
   - Backlink to `[[Plannotator Plans]]` for graph view
