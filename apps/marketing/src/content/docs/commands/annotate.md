The `/plannotator-annotate` command opens files, URLs, or folders in the Plannotator annotation UI.

## What you can annotate

| Input | Command | What happens |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Markdown file | `plannotator annotate README.md` | Opens the file directly |
| Plain-text file | `plannotator annotate config.yaml` | Opens the file directly, rendered as plain text |
| HTML file | `plannotator annotate docs/guide.html` | Renders the HTML directly |
| URL | `plannotator annotate https://docs.stripe.com/api` | Fetches the page, converts to markdown, then opens |
| Folder | `plannotator annotate ./docs/` | Opens a file browser showing all supported files |

### Supported file types

Beyond `.md`, `.mdx`, `.txt`, `.html`, and `.htm`, annotate accepts common plain-text config and data formats: `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.json`, `.jsonc`, `.json5`, `.toml`, `.ini`, `.cfg`, `.conf`, `.properties`, `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.log`, `.xml`, and `.env.example`. These render exactly like `.txt` — as plain text you can select and annotate.

`.env` is deliberately not supported: it commonly holds secrets, and annotate's version history copies file contents into the data dir (`~/.plannotator/history/`). Use `.env.example` for the secret-free template. Source-code files (`.ts`, `.py`, …) are also excluded — use `plannotator review` for code.

### Slash command (inside an agent session)

```
/plannotator-annotate path/to/file.md
/plannotator-annotate https://docs.stripe.com/api
/plannotator-annotate ./specs/
```

The agent runs `plannotator annotate <arg>` under the hood. The annotation UI opens in the browser. When you submit, feedback is returned to the agent as structured output.

### Standalone CLI (outside an agent session)

```bash
plannotator annotate path/to/file.md
plannotator annotate index.html
plannotator annotate https://example.com/docs
plannotator annotate ./docs/
```

Starts a local server, opens the browser, and blocks until you submit. Formatted feedback is printed to stdout.

## Folders

When you pass a folder, Plannotator opens a file browser showing all markdown and HTML files in the directory tree. Click any file to open it in the annotation UI. This is useful for annotating a set of specs, documentation, or your Obsidian vault.

Build output directories like `_site/`, `public/`, `.docusaurus/`, and `node_modules/` are automatically excluded from the file browser.

## URLs

Fetching a URL converts the page to markdown before opening it in the annotation editor.

### Jina Reader (default)

By default, URLs are fetched through [Jina Reader](https://jina.ai/reader/) (`r.jina.ai`). Jina handles JavaScript-rendered pages and returns clean, reader-mode markdown. This works well for documentation sites, blog posts, and API references.

Set `JINA_API_KEY` in your environment for higher rate limits (500 req/min vs 20 req/min unauthenticated). Free API keys are available from Jina.

### Direct fetch (`--no-jina`)

If you don't want to use Jina, pass `--no-jina`. Plannotator will fetch the HTML directly and convert it with Turndown. This is useful for pages behind authentication, internal docs, or when you just prefer not to route through a third-party service.

```bash
plannotator annotate https://internal.company.com/docs --no-jina
```

### .md and .mdx URLs

URLs ending in `.md` or `.mdx` are fetched as raw text with no conversion. If the server returns HTML instead (like GitHub's rendered markdown viewer), Plannotator falls through to Jina or Turndown automatically.

### Local and private URLs

URLs pointing to `localhost`, `127.x.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`, and other private or link-local addresses always use direct fetch. Jina is skipped automatically since it can't reach private networks.

### Configuring Jina

Three ways to disable Jina Reader, in priority order:

1. **CLI flag:** `--no-jina`
2. **Environment variable:** `PLANNOTATOR_JINA=0` or `PLANNOTATOR_JINA=false`
3. **Config file:** `~/.plannotator/config.json` with `{ "jina": false }`

If none of these are set, Jina is enabled by default.

## HTML files

Local `.html` and `.htm` files are read from disk and rendered as HTML by default. If you want Plannotator to convert the file to markdown first, pass `--markdown`.

```bash
plannotator annotate docs/guide.html --markdown
```

Markdown conversion uses [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown) with GFM table support. `<script>`, `<style>`, and `<noscript>` tags are stripped before conversion.

HTML files must be within your current working directory. Files outside the project root return a 403 error.

### `--markdown`

For local HTML files, `--markdown` switches from raw HTML rendering to markdown conversion. In folder mode, the same setting applies when you open `.html` or `.htm` files from the file browser.

## Source badge

When annotating an HTML file or URL (not plain markdown), a small badge appears under the document title showing where the content came from. For URLs it shows the hostname (e.g. "stripe.com"). For HTML files it shows the filename (e.g. "guide.html").

## Annotate mode differences

The annotation UI in annotate mode works the same as plan review, with a few changes:

- The "Approve" button is hidden by default (there's nothing to approve for most use cases). Pass `--gate` to enable it as a review decision.
- "Send Feedback" becomes **"Send Annotations"**
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` sends annotations instead of approving
- The completion screen says "Annotations Sent" instead of "Plan Approved"

All annotation types work identically: deletions, comments, global comments, quick labels, "looks good" approvals, and image attachments.

## Flags

Three opt-in flags turn annotate into a review gate for hook integrations (spec-driven frameworks, turn-by-turn review, and so on). They compose: use any alone or combine them.

### `--gate`

Adds a third **Approve** button to the UI. The reviewer now has three exits:

- **Approve** — the artifact looks good; the agent should proceed.
- **Send Annotations** — changes requested; feedback goes back to the agent.
- **Close** — dismissed without deciding.

### `--json`

Switches stdout to a structured decision object so hooks can route programmatically:

```json
{ "decision": "approved" | "annotated" | "dismissed", "feedback": "..." }
```

`feedback` is only present when `decision === "annotated"`.

### `--hook`

Emits hook-native JSON that works directly with Claude Code and Codex PostToolUse/Stop hook protocols. Implies `--gate` (always three-button UX). Approve and Close emit empty stdout (hook passes), Send Annotations emits `{"decision":"block","reason":"<feedback>"}` (hook blocks with feedback).

This is the recommended flag for hook integrations. If both `--hook` and `--json` are passed, `--hook` wins.

### Stdout matrix

| Flags | UX | Approve | Close | Send Annotations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | 2-button | n/a | empty | feedback (plaintext) |
| `--gate` | 3-button | `The user approved.` | empty | feedback (plaintext) |
| `--json` | 2-button | n/a | `{"decision":"dismissed"}` | `{"decision":"annotated","feedback":"..."}` |
| `--gate --json` | 3-button | `{"decision":"approved"}` | `{"decision":"dismissed"}` | `{"decision":"annotated","feedback":"..."}` |
| `--hook` | 3-button | empty | empty | `{"decision":"block","reason":"..."}` |

**Key property:** `--gate` plaintext output is unambiguous across three decisions. Use `--json` when you want machine-readable decision objects. Use `--hook` when wiring into Claude Code or Codex hooks directly.

On OpenCode and Pi, `--json` and `--hook` are silently accepted because those harnesses write back into the session directly rather than via stdout. The `--gate` flag behaves identically across all three harnesses.

See [Hook integration recipes](/docs/guides/hook-integration/) for ready-to-use PostToolUse and Stop hook examples.

## Feedback format

When you send annotations, they're exported as structured markdown:

```markdown
# Plan Feedback

I've reviewed this plan and have 2 pieces of feedback:

## 1. Remove this
` ` `
the selected text
` ` `
> I don't want this in the plan.

## 2. Feedback on: "some highlighted text"
> This needs more detail about error handling.

---
```

The agent receives this and can act on each annotation.

## Server API

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/plan` | GET | Returns `{ plan, mode: "annotate", filePath, sourceInfo, gate }` |
| `/api/feedback` | POST | Submit annotations |
| `/api/approve` | POST | Approve without feedback (`--gate` UX) |

| `/api/image` | GET | Serve image by path |
| `/api/upload` | POST | Upload image attachment |
| `/api/draft` | GET/POST/DELETE | Auto-save annotation drafts |

## Environment variables

The annotate server respects the same environment variables as plan review, plus two specific to URL annotation:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PLANNOTATOR_JINA` | enabled | Set to `0` or `false` to disable Jina Reader for URL annotation. |
| `JINA_API_KEY` | (none) | Optional Jina Reader API key for higher rate limits (500 RPM vs 20 RPM). |

See the [environment variables reference](/docs/reference/environment-variables/) for all options.
