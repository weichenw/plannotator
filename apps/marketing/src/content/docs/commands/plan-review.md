Plan review is the core Plannotator workflow. It's not a slash command. Plannotator opens automatically when the host agent reaches its plan handoff point.

## How it works

```
Claude calls ExitPlanMode
        ↓
PermissionRequest hook fires (hooks.json matcher: "ExitPlanMode")
        ↓
Bun server reads plan from stdin JSON (tool_input.plan)
        ↓
Server starts on random port, opens browser
        ↓
User reviews plan, optionally adds annotations
        ↓
Approve → agent proceeds with implementation
Deny    → annotations sent as structured feedback
        ↓
Agent resubmits → Plan Diff shows what changed
```

The hook configuration lives at `apps/hook/hooks/hooks.json` and matches the `ExitPlanMode` tool name.

## Codex flow

Codex does not expose a dedicated `ExitPlanMode` interception point. Instead, Plannotator integrates through Codex's experimental `Stop` hook.

```
Codex turn stops
        ↓
Stop hook fires
        ↓
Plannotator reads transcript_path rollout
        ↓
Latest completed plan item is extracted
fallback: raw <proposed_plan> block from assistant response
        ↓
Browser opens with the normal review UI
        ↓
Approve → turn stays completed
Deny    → Stop hook returns continuation feedback
        ↓
Codex revises the plan in the same turn
        ↓
Plannotator reopens only if the revised plan actually changed
```

This means Codex plan review is post-render rather than pre-submit, but you still get the same annotations, plan history, diff view, and revision loop.

The macOS, Linux, and WSL installer enables this hook automatically when Codex is installed or `~/.codex` already exists. Restart Codex Desktop or CLI after installing so the hook configuration is loaded.

## Annotation types

When you select text in the plan, the annotation toolbar appears with these options:

| Type | What it does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Deletion** | Marks text for removal | "Remove this section" |
| **Comment** | Adds feedback on a section | "This needs error handling" |
| **Quick label** | Applies a preset label (⚡) | "Clarify this", "Needs tests", "Out of scope" |
| **Looks good** | Marks a section as approved (👍) | — |
| **Global comment** | General feedback (not tied to text) | "The plan looks good overall but needs tests" |

If you want a replacement or an insertion, ask for it in a comment ("Change `WebSocket` to `SSE`" or "Add a retry mechanism here") — the agent will incorporate it during the revision.

## Image attachments

You can paste or upload images and attach them to annotations. Images are given human-readable names (e.g., "login-mockup") and referenced in the exported feedback. This is useful for sharing mockups, screenshots, or diagrams alongside your annotations.

To attach an image:
1. Copy an image to your clipboard
2. Paste anywhere in the Plannotator UI
3. Optionally draw on the image to highlight areas
4. Name the image and confirm

Images are stored as temporary files and referenced by name in the feedback sent to your agent.

## Approval flow

**Approve** (no annotations):
- Click "Approve" or press `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter`
- Optionally saves plan to disk or Obsidian/Bear
- Agent proceeds through its normal post-plan workflow

**Approve with annotations** (Claude Code):
- Claude Code doesn't yet support feedback on approval
- A warning dialog explains that annotations will be lost
- Use "Send Feedback" instead to include your annotations

**Approve with annotations** (OpenCode):
- OpenCode supports "approve with notes"
- Annotations are included in the approval response

**Send Feedback** (with annotations):
- Click "Send Feedback" or press `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter`
- Annotations are exported as structured markdown
- Agent receives feedback and revises the plan

## Agent switching (OpenCode)

OpenCode users can configure which agent receives the approved plan. By default, approved plans are handed off to the build agent. See [Agent switching settings](/docs/getting-started/ui-settings/#agent-switching).

If the configured agent isn't found in the current OpenCode session, Plannotator logs a warning and shows a warning toast, then omits the agent switch so the current/default OpenCode flow continues.
