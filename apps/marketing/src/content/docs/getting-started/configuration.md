Plannotator is configured through environment variables, hook/plugin configuration files, and an optional `~/.plannotator/config.json` file for persistent settings and feature-specific overrides.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE` | auto-detect | Set to `1` or `true` to force remote mode, `0` or `false` to force local mode, or leave unset to auto-detect via `SSH_TTY` / `SSH_CONNECTION`. Uses a fixed port in remote mode; browser-opening behavior depends on the environment. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_PORT` | random (local) / `19432` (remote) | Fixed server port. Useful for port forwarding in remote environments. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_URL_HOST` | unset (`localhost`) | Display-only hostname for advertised session URLs in remote mode (e.g. a Tailscale MagicDNS name). The runtime-chosen port is always appended; binding is unaffected and local sessions ignore the override. Can also be set via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "urlHost": "host" }`). |
| `PLANNOTATOR_BROWSER` | system default | Custom browser or script to open the UI. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_AI` | enabled | Set to `disabled` to disable Ask AI, Review Agents, and Guided Review. External agents can still open reviews and submit annotations; the annotate agent terminal is separate. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_SHARE` | enabled | Set to `disabled` to turn off URL sharing entirely. Can also be set via `~/.plannotator/config.json` (`{ "share": "disabled" }`). |
| `PLANNOTATOR_SHARE_URL` | `https://share.plannotator.ai` | Point share links at a self-hosted portal. |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | `~/.claude` | Respected by the install script when placing hooks. |

See the [environment variables reference](/docs/reference/environment-variables/) for full details, port resolution order, and examples.

## Hook configuration (Claude Code)

The hook is defined in `hooks.json` inside the plugin directory. When installed via the marketplace, this is managed automatically. For manual installation, add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PermissionRequest": [
      {
        "matcher": "ExitPlanMode",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "plannotator",
            "timeout": 345600
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `matcher` targets the `ExitPlanMode` tool specifically. The `timeout` is in seconds (`345600` = 96 hours) — long reviews can stay open without expiring.

## Plugin configuration (OpenCode)

OpenCode uses `opencode.json` to load the plugin:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["@plannotator/opencode@latest"]
}
```

This uses the default `plan-agent` workflow: `submit_plan` is registered for OpenCode's `plan` agent, while `build` and other primary agents do not see it.

To configure the workflow explicitly:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "plan-agent",
      "planningAgents": ["plan"]
    }]
  ]
}
```

When Plannotator is used with other OpenCode plugins, the options object must stay attached to the Plannotator plugin entry:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "plan-agent",
      "planningAgents": ["plan", "sisyphus"]
    }],
    "oh-my-opencode-slim",
    "openviking-opencode"
  ]
}
```

Use `workflow: "manual"` for commands-only mode, or `workflow: "all-agents"` to restore the legacy behavior where primary agents can call `submit_plan`. In `plan-agent` mode, any names listed in `planningAgents` are added alongside OpenCode's built-in `plan` agent. Slash commands (`/plannotator-review`, `/plannotator-annotate`, `/plannotator-last`) require the CLI to be installed separately via the install script.

If you are upgrading from an older OpenCode install, see the [OpenCode 0.19.1 migration guide](/docs/guides/opencode-migration-0-19-1/).

## Plan saving

Approved and denied plans are saved to `~/.plannotator/plans/` by default. You can change the save directory or disable saving in the Plannotator UI settings (gear icon).

## Config file

Plannotator reads `~/.plannotator/config.json` for persistent settings. This includes display name, diff options, conventional comment labels, and feedback message customization.

You can customize the messages Plannotator sends to the agent when you approve, deny, or annotate plans and documents. See the [custom feedback guide](/docs/guides/custom-feedback/) for the full config shape, template variables, and runtime-specific overrides.

## Remote mode

When working over SSH, in a devcontainer, or in Docker, set `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE=1` (or `true`) and `PLANNOTATOR_PORT` to a port you'll forward. Set `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE=0` / `false` if you need to force local behavior even when SSH env vars are present. See the [remote & devcontainers guide](/docs/guides/remote-and-devcontainers/) for setup instructions.

## Custom browser

`PLANNOTATOR_BROWSER` accepts an app name (macOS), executable path (Linux/Windows), or a custom script. This is useful for opening Plannotator in a specific browser or handling URL opening in unusual environments.

```bash
# macOS
export PLANNOTATOR_BROWSER="Google Chrome"

# Linux
export PLANNOTATOR_BROWSER="/usr/bin/firefox"

# Custom script
export PLANNOTATOR_BROWSER="/path/to/my-open-script.sh"
```

For one-off overrides without changing your shell profile, use the `--browser` flag:

```bash
plannotator review --browser "Safari"
plannotator annotate plan.md --browser "Firefox"
```

## Session discovery

If you accidentally close a Plannotator browser tab, the server is still running — you just need the URL. The `sessions` subcommand lists active sessions and can reopen them:

```bash
plannotator sessions              # list active sessions
plannotator sessions --open       # reopen most recent session
plannotator sessions --open 2     # reopen a specific session
plannotator sessions --clean      # remove stale session files
```

Sessions are tracked automatically. Stale entries from crashed processes are cleaned up on the next listing.

## Disabling sharing

Set `PLANNOTATOR_SHARE=disabled` to remove all sharing UI — the Share tab, copy link action, and import review option are all hidden. Useful for teams working with sensitive plans. To make this persistent without an environment variable, add `"share": "disabled"` to `~/.plannotator/config.json`. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file.

To self-host the share portal instead, see the [self-hosting guide](/docs/guides/self-hosting/).

## Disabling AI

Set `PLANNOTATOR_AI=disabled` to disable Ask AI and the Review Agents / Guided Review execution surfaces, including provider and agent-job endpoints. Persisted guide data is retained and its server APIs remain available, but the in-app history browser is hidden while AI is disabled. External agents can still open reviews and submit annotations. The explicit annotate-mode agent terminal is a separate feature and remains controlled by its own settings.
