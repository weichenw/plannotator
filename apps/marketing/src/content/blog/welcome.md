Plannotator is a plan review UI for Claude Code that intercepts `ExitPlanMode` via hooks, letting you approve or request changes with annotated feedback.

## What is Plannotator?

When Claude Code generates a plan, Plannotator opens an interactive review UI in your browser. You can read through the plan, select text to annotate, and provide structured feedback — deletions, comments, global comments, quick labels, and "looks good" approvals — before approving or requesting changes.

## Key Features

- **Plan Review** — Intercepts `ExitPlanMode` and opens a rich annotation UI
- **Code Review** — Run `/plannotator-review` to review uncommitted changes with a diff viewer
- **Annotate** — Run `/plannotator-annotate` to annotate any markdown file
- **Legacy Link Sharing** — Small markdown shares use URL fragments; larger and raw HTML shares can use encrypted short links
- **Obsidian Integration** — Auto-save reviewed plans to your Obsidian vault

## Getting Started

Check out the [installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installation/) to get started with Plannotator in Claude Code or OpenCode.
